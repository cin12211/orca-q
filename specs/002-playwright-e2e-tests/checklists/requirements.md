# Specification Quality Checklist: Playwright Browser E2E Tests — Workspace & Connection Flow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.implement`.
- US6 (connection credentials with real DB) gracefully handles missing env var via skip — documented in FR-009 and SC-006.
- Playwright-specific implementation details (config file paths, script names, page objects) are confined to FR-001–FR-010 requirements only, not mixed into user stories.
