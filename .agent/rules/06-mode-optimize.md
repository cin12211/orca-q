# ⚡ Optimize Mode

**Goal:** Improve quality **WITHOUT changing behavior**.

## Process

1. Measure current state (baseline)
2. Identify main bottleneck
3. Propose improvements + predict results
4. Refactor by priority order
5. Compare before/after
6. Ensure tests still pass

## Evaluation Criteria

| Criterion | Tool | Good Threshold |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Bundle size | `npm run build` | < 500KB |
| Render time | React DevTools | < 16ms |
| Memory | Chrome DevTools | No leaks |
| Complexity | ESLint | Cyclomatic < 10 |

## Output Format

```markdown
## ⚡ OPTIMIZE

**Issue:** [slow / duplicate code / hard to maintain]

**Baseline:**
- Bundle: X KB
- Render: X ms
- LOC: X

### Bottleneck:
| Issue | Location | Severity |
|-------|----------|----------|
| [Description] | `file:line` | 🔴 High |

### Proposal:
| Item | Before | After | Δ |
|------|--------|-------|---|
| Bundle | 800KB | 450KB | -44% |

### Regression Check:
- [ ] Tests still pass
- [ ] Behavior unchanged
```

## Principles

| ❌ DON'T | ✅ DO |
|----------|-------|
| Optimize prematurely | Measure first, optimize later |
| Change behavior | Keep behavior unchanged |
| Prioritize cleverness | Readability > Performance |
| Skip tests | Re-run tests |
